# List – Items + Why:

- Sudoku book: I would bring this item because if I ever feel like I’m struggling to focus on anything, I can do a sudoku puzzle knowing I would be able to focus on it until I complete it.
- G-Shock Watch: I found this watch that I’ve had for years but never wore, but thought about how it’s stopwatch would be useful for when I play sudoku. It would be much better than when I have to use my phone as a timer. I think the batteries for the one I have lasts 10 years. And when I opened it’s case for the first time in years, it was still running this whole time. 
- Pencils: I need these for sudoku.
- Notebook: So I can write in it. Maybe to leave a message somewhere or track things that have happened. I can write anything in it.
- Touchland hand sanitizer: I always have one on me. That is why. 
- Alcohol pads + bandages: These are first aid things, so that would be helpful for… first aid
- Portable charger: For any devices I would want to charge. But if it only has one life, I must pick what I charge wisely.

# Reflection:

The kind of scenario this go bag prepares me for is an apocalypse. Or something of that nature. I think I am underprepared though. So maybe for a storm. It’s almost a survival kit. The sudoku is for dealing with boredom. And everything else should be helpful for surviving someeething. So this bag has some essentials but also the optional book I included.

The aspect of resilience that these support is the survival aspect, if resilience has a survival aspect. They are to help me endure a not ideal situation. Something I learned was that I had a G-Shock watch in a drawer for years. I wouldn’t have worn it if I knew anyway but still, so this was also surprising. And I ended up reading the manual so that I would know how to use the stopwatch feature. I also learned about some basic things that a first aid kit might include, with my bag having 2 of them.
