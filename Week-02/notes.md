# Notes

## Maps

Types of Maps:
- Political
- Topographic
- Economic/resource map
- Transit map
- Weather map
- Historical map

Snapshots show changes of a map over time

Maps can be weaponized
- Ex: redlining
- Ex: creating narratives/counternarratives

Collections vs systems

Mapping is not neutral

Mapping can come from a deficit perspective

On the other hand, there is asset based framing
