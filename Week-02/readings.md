# Asset Mapping Overview

The overview was helpful, particularly the visuals such as the 'What Asset Mapping is and is Not'. The last item discussing how it is an iterative process is very important, because you don't just do asset mapping one time and that's it. Things change and that should be reflected, since these are resources meant to help the community. Seeing how residents are empowered by this helps me understand how it is important when it was originally confusing to me.

# Building resilience with community technology across the United States

The discussion of community networks was really interesting. Seeing how there is free internet being brought to more isolated areas, while also being a net neutral service that isn't purposefully slowed down for smaller communities, can inspire other communities to try to achieve the same thing. However, these community networks are said to be growing slower than large international community networks. This is something I would definitely want to learn more about.
