# Reflection

I took pictures of cameras, antennas, probably a junction box, and what might be a small cell equipment box, based on what I looked up. These were all taken very close along Flatbush Ave. An antenna is used for wireless communication with examples for TV and radio. Junctino boxes are what connects buildings to ISPs. Small cell equipment box is like a little cell node I think. They help coverage for 5G. Cameras transmit video data over networks.
