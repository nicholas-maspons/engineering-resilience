# Location

My node is indoors, sitting on top of my desk at my dorm. When I'm not using my charger for my laptop and am in my dorm, it will be plugged in and running. I've been from Primay Channel which I think is just anyone nearby with a node. They said gn gn. My messages are bring acknowledged and I am receiving some, so it appeards I am connected to the network.

I haven't been seeing any interruptions, except for when I leave with my charger and it eventually dies. It seems to be running just fine. Ever since getting the charger to work, I aven't had any issues. I'm just still confused on how this thing works. Like do I still receive messages if my node is dead? Would they be there once I turn it on? Does my node still receive messages if I'm not near it with my phone? I don't think I'd be able to check anyway because I would be too far for bluetooth. I learned about hops in networking and how you can control the amount in settings.
