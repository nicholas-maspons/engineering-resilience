# Wireless Community Networks for Resilience

- Wireless signals occupy an entire spectrum of the elctronmagentic field.

- Longer wave lengths cover much more ground, so the signal reachers further distances. 

- The farther you want to reach, the more current you need.

- Telecommunications are very dependent on energy availability. Frequencies are measured in hertz.

- FCC controls how we split up, allocate, share different bandwidth. Before wifi networks, we relied on cellular networks, specially GSM

- OpenWRT was for routing and network devices. Idk.

- Physical cable connects to buildings with fiber optics, or ethernet. Then a device that takes that connection and passed it through. Missed some notes

- Reason why you might want a community network over traditional:
Control and governance. Networks can discriminate . So can certain buildings. 

- Each node you need before signal reaches destination is hops? 

- Network topology. On slideshow, which is more centralized: A | B is more resilient

- Guifi is the largest community network in the world (maybe). Is in Spain.

- LoRa is only good for texts really (anything with small amounts of data) 

- A lot of wifi networks start after major hurricanes or any other major disruptions

- Dont use bluetooth? P2p network. Not buying / using something from “him”. I wasn't listening 

- NUMBER ONE RULE for networking: Don't power the equipment without the antenna. Don't power radio without an antenna. It won’t know what to do with the energy. 

- Lora will be used as a standalone modem with your phone
