# Networks of New York by Ingrid Burrington

Learning about the different markings was new as I've seen them before but never actually knew what they meant. And seeing that they are beneath and all around us is very interesting. I already knew that but the reading makes me think more deeply about it. 

These markings make me think of another way of communication that the average person won't be able to understand. An example is how fire hydrants have different colors to tell firefighters different info, even if everyone else does not understand.

My question is who gets to make the decisions of where this infrastructure goes and who does it serve? Since these networks are basically invisible, maybe that makes it easier to distribute internet access unequally without it being known.

This reading told me about how resilience is not permanent, with the example being the Red Hook mesh network. The support following Sandy faded away and the network ended up decreasing in size. The initial disaster response was different from long term community infrastructure support. The need for help didn't go away but support stopped. 

This makes me think of how when there is a disaster, it gets a lot of attention and there are then a lot of donations and volunteers. But then maybe after a few months, there is another disaster. Then attention and resources get directed there, reasonably so. But the others are still left dealing with the aftermath. 

My question is why internet access is being treated as less essential than other resources like electricity or water, when today, it is also very important
