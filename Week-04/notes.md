# Solar Energy Notes

- Solar generation. Tells how much how fast to charge the battery. And the battery itself

- The brain of the operaton is called a charge controller

- There are PWM charge controller, and MPPT charge controllers (more expensive)

- Seal gel, lithium, lead-acid are chemistries of batteries

- Solar panels are rated for 20-25 years of life

- There isn't a good system for recycling solar panels now. People replace them when they still function

- Batteries are the most expensive and most delicate. 5-7 year life cycle (lasts the least time) if charged efficiently. If you ignore a battery, the who system is like 70% cheaper

- Solar survey to see if somewhere is a good spot for a panel

- Install it a 10-15 degree angle. In order to maximize energy generation and for washing

- Have Raspberry Pi be the data collection platform

- Battery goes first because you need to store the electricity somewhere

- When taking it apart, it's reverse order. You remove the panel/energy source first

- All electronics are affected by eat. So they have temperature sensors
