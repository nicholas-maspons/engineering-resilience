# Reflection

A practice of mine that relies on the sun is me having it serve as my alarm clock. Since I don't have to wake up early for 8ams, I can just not have an alarm. And then I let the sun wake me up instead. Aside from that, none of my activities rely on the sun. Like playing basketball. It would be nice if the sun is out, but as long as it isn't windy and not too cold. 

If I had to prioritize powering something if the sun powered everything, it would be refrigerating (for food), water systems, and my phone for when needed to communicate. Then thereis heating and cooling. Of course it depends on the weather, but I would want cooling over heating because I feel like too much heat can pose a threat faster. You can always put on more clothes, but you can't take off more when it comes to heat. There is also lighting to consider, but maybe I could just have a lot of batteries for falshlights. 

I would then have to use an alarm to wake up. But what if it isn't powered? Then I would use that watch I have in my go bag. I would have to get all my tasks done in the day time, assuming they require eneergy.
