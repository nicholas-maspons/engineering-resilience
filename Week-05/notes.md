# Ecology Notes

- 'Ecology' is a term that became institutionalized in the 1800s

- The study of every living thing in every environment. About ecosystems and the ecosystems within those ecosystems...

- IEK (Indigenous Ecological Knowledge): a vast intergenerational body of knowledge abiut the environment, its components and human interactions with it, passed down through cultures, practices, and philosophies

- Ecologists practice/study ecology (wow)

- Citizen science is when the public participates in scientific research

- Hyperlocal data:
    - Hydrangea colros - correlate with soil PH
    - Tree rings - indicate age of tree and growth conditions. Thinner rings indicate dry season
    - Shell bands - record their growth and the environment
    - Cricket chirps - chirp more frequently in higher temperatures
    - Lichen variety - diversity indicates air quality. Are very sensitive to pollutants
    - Woolly bear caterpillars - band colors indicate age and environment factors. Like a record

# Environmental Sensing for Citizen Science

- Inputs, sensing the environment

- Outputs, affecting the environment

- Arduinos are not very good a multitasking. Though they are improving

- Am I touching a table, binary.

- How much weight am I putting on the table, analog.

- digitalRead(), you listen to inputs

- digitalWrite(), you output voltage

- analogRead() analogWrite()

- Use jumper wires to connect components

- All the elctricity you feed into your circuit needs to be consumed
